## 🟢 Junior Full-Stack Developer

**Focus:** Foundations, learning how things connect end-to-end.

### Core Development

* [ ] Use Git daily (clone, branch, commit, push, pull)
* [ ] Resolve simple merge conflicts
* [ ] Understand how frontend talks to backend (HTTP, JSON)
* [ ] Build a basic frontend (React / Vue / Angular / similar)
* [ ] Build a basic backend API (Node, Python, Java, etc.)
* [ ] Connect backend to a database (CRUD)
* [ ] Use environment variables locally
* [ ] Read stack traces and error messages
* [ ] Write basic unit tests
* [ ] Use browser dev tools (network, console)

### Tooling & Workflow

* [ ] Use a code editor intentionally (extensions, formatting)
* [ ] Run apps locally using setup instructions
* [ ] Use package managers (npm, pip, etc.)
* [ ] Follow an existing project structure
* [ ] Ask good technical questions

### Deployment (Intro)

* [ ] Deploy a project to the internet (even if simple)
* [ ] Understand what breaks when deploying vs local
* [ ] Use GitHub (repo, README, issues)

### Mindset

* [ ] Accept you don’t know much *yet*
* [ ] Can explain your project to another person
* [ ] Say “I’m learning full-stack development” confidently

✅ **If most are ✔ or 🟡 → you are legitimately a Junior Full-Stack Dev**

* [ ] Refactor messy code safely
* [ ] Write meaningful tests (unit + some integration)
* [ ] Review PRs and give constructive feedback
* [ ] Read and modify legacy code
* [ ] Use design patterns *when appropriate*

### Frontend Depth

* [ ] Manage application state properly
* [ ] Handle loading, error, and edge states

* [ ] Implement auth flows (login, refresh tokens, roles)

### Backend Depth

* [ ] Design database schemas intentionally
* [ ] Write efficient queries
* [ ] Handle authentication & authorization
* [ ] Validate and sanitize user input

### DevOps & Deployment

* [ ] Configure CI/CD pipelines
* [ ] Manage secrets securely
* [ ] Read production logs and metrics
* [ ] Perform a rollback if needed

### AI & Productivity

* [ ] Use AI to speed up development responsibly
* [ ] Review AI-generated code critically
* [ ] Use AI to explore unfamiliar codebases

### Professional Skills

* [ ] Estimate tasks realistically
* [ ] Push back on unclear requirements
* [ ] Communicate trade-offs to non-technical people
* [ ] Mentor juniors informally

✅ **If most are ✔ → you’re solidly Mid-Level**

* [ ] Communicate clearly with stakeholders
* [ ] Translate business goals into technical strategy

### AI Strategy

* [ ] Define how the team uses AI effectively
* [ ] Prevent over-reliance on AI

* [ ] Trusted to make hard technical calls
* [ ] Others come to you for guidance
* [ ] When asked what you do, you simply say:

  > **“I’m a senior full-stack developer.”**

✅ **If these resonate → you already are one**

## 🧠 How to Use This Checklist

* You **do not** need 100% ✔ to be at a level
* 🟡 items are *normal* — they show growth areas
* Seniors still have ✖ items (that’s reality)
* The difference between levels is **scope, ownership, and impact**

---

## Final Reality Check

> **You are not promoted by learning tools.
> You level up by taking responsibility.**
