# Full-Stack Developer — Self-Assessment Checklist (2026)

Use this scale for each item:

* ✔ **I do this confidently**
* 🟡 **I’ve done it with help / inconsistently**
* ✖ **Not yet**

---

## Junior Full-Stack Developer

**Focus:** Foundations, learning how things connect end-to-end.

### Core Development

* 🟡 Use Git daily (clone, branch, commit, push, pull)
* 🟡 Resolve simple merge conflicts
* [x] Understand how frontend talks to backend (HTTP, JSON)
* [x] Build a basic frontend (React / Vue / Angular / similar)
* [x] Build a basic backend API (Node, Python, Java, etc.)
* [x] Connect backend to a database (CRUD)
* [x] Use environment variables locally
* [ ] Read stack traces and error messages
* [ ] Write basic unit tests
* [x] Use browser dev tools (network, console)

### Tooling & Workflow

* [x] Use a code editor intentionally (extensions, formatting)
* [x] Run apps locally using setup instructions
* [x] Use package managers (npm, pip, etc.)
* [x] Follow an existing project structure
* [x] Ask good technical questions

### Deployment (Intro)

* [x] Deploy a project to the internet (even if simple)
* [x] Understand what breaks when deploying vs local
* [x] Use GitHub (repo, README, issues)

### Mindset

* [x] Accept you don’t know much *yet*
* [x] Can explain your project to another person
* [x] Say “I’m learning full-stack development” confidently

✓ **If most are ✔ or 🟡 → you are legitimately a Junior Full-Stack Dev**

## Mid-Level Full-Stack Developer

**Focus:** Ownership, reliability, working independently.

### Architecture & Code Quality

* [ ] Design simple but scalable APIs
* [ ] Separate concerns (frontend, backend, data)
* [ ] Refactor messy code safely
* [ ] Write meaningful tests (unit + some integration)
* [ ] Review PRs and give constructive feedback
* [ ] Read and modify legacy code
* [ ] Use design patterns *when appropriate*

### Frontend Depth

* [ ] Manage application state properly
* [ ] Handle loading, error, and edge states
* [ ] Understand performance basics (re-renders, bundles)
* [ ] Implement auth flows (login, refresh tokens, roles)

### Backend Depth

* [ ] Design database schemas intentionally
* [ ] Write efficient queries
* [ ] Handle authentication & authorization
* [ ] Validate and sanitize user input
* [ ] Handle background jobs or async tasks

### DevOps & Deployment

* [ ] Use Docker (or clearly explain why not)
* [ ] Configure CI/CD pipelines
* [ ] Manage secrets securely
* [ ] Read production logs and metrics
* [ ] Perform a rollback if needed

### AI & Productivity

* [ ] Use AI to speed up development responsibly
* [ ] Review AI-generated code critically
* [ ] Use AI to explore unfamiliar codebases

### Professional Skills

* [ ] Estimate tasks realistically
* [ ] Push back on unclear requirements
* [ ] Communicate trade-offs to non-technical people
* [ ] Mentor juniors informally

✅ **If most are ✔ → you’re solidly Mid-Level**

## Senior Full-Stack Developer

**Focus:** Impact, leadership, long-term thinking.

### System Design & Architecture

* [ ] Design systems for scale, failure, and change
* [ ] Make architectural decisions and explain them
* [ ] Balance speed vs maintainability
* [ ] Identify and reduce technical debt
* [ ] Know when *not* to over-engineer

### Frontend Leadership

* [ ] Define frontend architecture and conventions
* [ ] Ensure accessibility and UX quality
* [ ] Guide performance optimizations
* [ ] Set standards for testing and structure

### Backend Leadership

* [ ] Design resilient APIs and services
* [ ] Handle concurrency and data consistency
* [ ] Think in terms of reliability and observability
* [ ] Own security implications of design choices

### Infrastructure & Reliability

* [ ] Understand cloud architecture deeply
* [ ] Optimize costs without harming reliability
* [ ] Design monitoring, alerts, and logs
* [ ] Handle incidents calmly and methodically

### Team & Organizational Impact

* [ ] Raise the bar for code quality across the team
* [ ] Mentor intentionally and consistently
* [ ] Influence technical direction
* [ ] Communicate clearly with stakeholders
* [ ] Translate business goals into technical strategy

### AI Strategy

* [ ] Define how the team uses AI effectively
* [ ] Prevent over-reliance on AI
* [ ] Evaluate AI trade-offs (security, IP, correctness)

### Identity

* [ ] Comfortable saying “I don’t know” when appropriate
* [ ] Trusted to make hard technical calls
* [ ] Others come to you for guidance
* [ ] When asked what you do, you simply say:

  > **“I’m a senior full-stack developer.”**

✅ **If these resonate → you already are one**

## How to Use This Checklist

* You **do not** need 100% ✔ to be at a level
* 🟡 items are *normal* — they show growth areas
* Seniors still have ✖ items (that’s reality)
* The difference between levels is **scope, ownership, and impact**

---

## Final Reality Check

> **You are not promoted by learning tools. You level up by taking responsibility.**
