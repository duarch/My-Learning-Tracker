# 🎯 Full-Stack Developer Career Roadmap (6–12 Months)

---

## 🗓 Months 1–3: Solidify Foundations & Confidence

**Goal:** Become fully comfortable shipping small full-stack features alone.

### Technical Goals

* [ ] Build and deploy **one complete full-stack project**

  * Frontend (React or equivalent)
  * Backend API
  * Database
  * Auth (basic)
* [ ] Use Git fluently (branches + PRs)
* [ ] Write unit tests for backend logic
* [ ] Handle errors properly (frontend + backend)
* [ ] Use environment variables correctly (local + prod)

### Workflow Goals

* [ ] Open at least **3 meaningful PRs** (even solo)
* [ ] Write a clear README
* [ ] Use AI to accelerate development *without copying blindly*

### Confidence Signal

* [ ] Explain your architecture decisions out loud
* [ ] Say: *“I can build and deploy a full-stack app”*

🎯 **Outcome:** You are undeniably a **Junior Full-Stack Developer**.

## 🗓 Months 4–6: Ownership & Production Thinking

**Goal:** Move from “it works” → “it works reliably”.

### Technical Goals

* [ ] Add integration tests to a real project
* [ ] Implement proper authentication & authorization
* [ ] Refactor at least one messy feature
* [ ] Introduce Docker *or* justify not using it
* [ ] Use CI/CD (GitHub Actions is enough)
* [ ] Use logs to debug a production issue

### Frontend Depth

* [ ] Handle loading, error, and empty states properly
* [ ] Improve performance in at least one area
* [ ] Make UI accessible (basic a11y)

### Backend Depth

* [ ] Design a non-trivial data model
* [ ] Optimize at least one slow query
* [ ] Validate user input defensively

### Professional Growth

* [ ] Review someone else’s code
* [ ] Help a junior developer/debugger
* [ ] Push back on unclear requirements

🎯 **Outcome:** You’re operating at a **Mid-Level Full-Stack** scope.

## 🗓 Months 7–12: Impact, Leadership & Senior Signals

**Goal:** Demonstrate *senior behaviors*, even without the title.

### Architecture & Scale

* [ ] Design a system before coding it
* [ ] Document architectural decisions
* [ ] Handle failures gracefully (timeouts, retries)
* [ ] Reduce technical debt intentionally

### Infrastructure & Reliability

* [ ] Set up monitoring and basic alerts
* [ ] Understand hosting costs and trade-offs
* [ ] Perform a safe rollback
* [ ] Handle secrets rotation

### AI Strategy

* [ ] Define a personal workflow using AI effectively
* [ ] Refactor AI-generated code safely
* [ ] Teach someone else how to use AI responsibly

### Visibility & Influence

* [ ] Write a technical blog post or internal doc
* [ ] Give a talk (meetup, team, online)
* [ ] Mentor someone consistently for 3+ months

🎯 **Outcome:** You are *functioning* as a **Senior Full-Stack Dev**, title or not.

# 🪣 Personal Full-Stack Developer Bucket List (2026)

This is your **“proof I’m a developer” list**, inspired by the original article — but modern and personal.

### 🚀 Build & Ship

* [ ] Build a full-stack app from scratch
* [ ] Deploy it with a custom domain
* [ ] Add authentication & authorization
* [ ] Add tests that catch a real bug
* [ ] Break production and fix it
* [ ] Ship at least one meaningful update

### 🛠 Workflow Mastery

* [ ] Use Git without fear
* [ ] Resolve a painful merge conflict
* [ ] Review and approve a PR
* [ ] Write documentation someone thanks you for
* [ ] Automate something boring

### 🤖 AI Collaboration

* [ ] Use AI to explore a new codebase
* [ ] Catch a bug AI introduced
* [ ] Improve AI output with better prompts
* [ ] Decide *not* to use AI in a situation

### 🌐 Community & Growth

* [ ] Ask a good technical question publicly
* [ ] Answer someone else’s question
* [ ] Contribute to open source (docs or code)
* [ ] Attend a meetup or conference
* [ ] Speak or write about something you learned

### 💼 Professional Identity

* [ ] Get paid to code
* [ ] Negotiate scope or deadlines
* [ ] Push back on a bad technical decision
* [ ] Mentor a junior dev
* [ ] When asked what you do, say:

  > **“I’m a full-stack developer.”**

## 🧠 How to Track This (Important)

* Turn this into:

  * A **Notion page**
  * A **Markdown file in a GitHub repo**
  * Or a **README in your portfolio**
* Mark dates, not just checkboxes
* Write short reflections: *what was hard? what changed?*

## Final Thought (The Real Truth)

> **Confidence doesn’t come from knowing everything.
> It comes from having *done enough real things* that doubt loses credibility.**
